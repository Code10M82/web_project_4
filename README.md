# Project 4: Around The U.S.

## Introduction

* Around the US is a website that allows you to add and like your favorite places from around the world. 

## Technologies Used

* I introduce some interaction with this website! I have implemented JavaScript for the first time into my website. Responsive with uses of Flex and Grid. 

## The Future

* I will be continuing to use JavaScript to get the page fully functioning.
